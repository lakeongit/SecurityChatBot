Here's an example of how you can create a SecurityChatBot in Python using the Streamlit framework and integrating it with an S3 bucket.

```python
import boto3
import streamlit as st

# Initialize the S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Function to read file from S3 bucket
def read_from_s3(bucket_name, file_name):
    try:
        response = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_name)
        contents = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')
        return contents
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error reading file from S3: {e}")
        return None

# Main function to run the SecurityChatBot
def run_security_chatbot():
    # Set the title and description
    st.title("Security ChatBot")
    st.write("Welcome to the Security ChatBot!")

    # Get the S3 bucket and file name from the user
    bucket_name = st.text_input("Enter S3 bucket name:")
    file_name = st.text_input("Enter file name to read from S3:")

    # Read the file from S3
    if st.button("Read File"):
        if bucket_name and file_name:
            file_contents = read_from_s3(bucket_name, file_name)
            if file_contents:
                st.success("File read successfully!")
                st.code(file_contents)
        else:
            st.warning("Please enter the S3 bucket name and file name.")

# Run the SecurityChatBot
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_security_chatbot()
```

To deploy the SecurityChatBot on an EC2 instance, follow these steps:

1. Set up an EC2 instance with adequate memory and install Python and pip.
2. Copy the above code to a file named `security_chatbot.py` on the EC2 instance.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install boto3 streamlit
   ```
4. Set up your AWS credentials on the EC2 instance using the AWS CLI or by configuring environment variables.
5. Start the Streamlit server by running the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run security_chatbot.py
   ```
6. The Streamlit server should start running and provide a URL. Access that URL from your web browser, and you should see the Security ChatBot interface.
7. Enter the S3 bucket name and file name to read from, and click the "Read File" button to read the file from the S3 bucket.

Make sure you have the necessary IAM permissions to read from the S3 bucket. If you encounter any issues, double-check your AWS credentials, IAM permissions, and the S3 bucket's accessibility.
